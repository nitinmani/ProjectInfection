# ProjectInfection

## Contact Information
* Nitin Manivasagan <nitinmani@berkeley.edu>

### Documentation for all three tasks is in the pdf. 
### Please look through that for a detailed explanation of how I have implemented everything.

##### How To Run 
  * Compile all the files. 
  * Then run this command `java Infecter txtFile`, where each line of txtFile is of the format:  
   * [UserID][Version][StudentId1][StudentId2]...[StudentIdN]
  * All of the ids must be long values
  * After doing so, you will get prompted with the type of infection you want to perform, and depending on the infection, you will get prompted with other needed information. It should be very self explanatory once you type in the command, on what you will need to input.
  * I have added a folder with sample files that you can use to test the algorithm
